# File-Read-Write-Challenge-and-Error-Handling-Lab
Python program that reads a file and writes a modified version to a new file and asks the user for a filename and also handle errors if it doesn’t exist or can’t be read.


How it works:
Prompts the user to input a filename.

Tries to open and read the file; if the file doesn’t exist or cannot be read, it handles the exceptions with informative messages.

Modifies the content by converting it to uppercase (you can change the modification logic as needed).

Writes the modified content to a new file prefixed by modified_.

Catches and reports any unexpected errors to keep the program robust.
